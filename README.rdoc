= PgPolymorphicConstraints

There's nothing here yet, but this plugin will eventually provide a way to add
trigger-based polymorphic foreign key constraints to PostgreSQL tables that
behave roughly the same as PostgreSQL's native foreign key constraints.

= TODO

* Generate migration to add plpgsql and trigger function
* Migration helper to create/drop constraint
* Migration helper to create/drop table_name column
* ActiveRecord class method to create association table_name column callback
